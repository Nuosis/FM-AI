1. a Missing or Incorrect Mcp-Session-Id Header
Client Fails to Send Header: The client must include the Mcp-Session-Id header in both POST (for requests) and GET (for SSE stream) requests. If omitted, the server may not associate the connection with a session. ‚ùå

1. b Server Fails to Read Header: The server must correctly parse the Mcp-Session-Id header from incoming requests. Case sensitivity, typos, or incorrect header parsing can cause failures.

1. c Session ID Mismatch: If the client sends a different session ID for POST and GET, or if the server expects a specific format, the session may not be recognized.


2. Session State Not Properly Managed on the Server
Stateless Implementation: If the server does not maintain a mapping of session IDs to client state, it cannot resume or associate streams correctly.
Session Expiry or Cleanup: Sessions may be prematurely expired or cleaned up on the server, especially after connection drops or timeouts, causing the session ID to become invalid.
Improper Session Initialization: If the session is not created during the initial handshake or is not persisted, subsequent requests with the same session ID will fail.
3. Transport/Connection Issues
SSE Connection Drops: If the SSE connection drops and the client attempts to reconnect with the same session ID, but the server has already cleaned up the session, the session cannot be resumed.
Improper Handling of Last-Event-ID: For resumability, the client should send Last-Event-ID on reconnect. If the server ignores this or does not replay missed events, session continuity is broken.
Multiple Clients Using Same Session ID: If two clients use the same session ID concurrently, the server may get confused or overwrite state.
4. CORS and Security Headers
CORS Misconfiguration: If the server does not allow the Mcp-Session-Id header in CORS preflight (Access-Control-Allow-Headers), browsers will block the request, and the session ID will not be sent.
Origin Restrictions: If the server rejects requests based on the Origin header, the session may not be established.
5. Protocol Version or Capability Negotiation Issues
Initialization Sequence Not Followed: If the client sends requests before the MCP initialization handshake is complete, the server may reject them, including those with session IDs.
Protocol Version Mismatch: If the client and server negotiate incompatible protocol versions, session management may not work as expected.
6. Bugs in SDK or Manual Implementation
SDK Version Bugs: Outdated or buggy SDKs may mishandle session IDs, especially if the protocol has changed.
Manual HTTP Handler Errors: If not using the official SDK, manual parsing and state management can easily introduce bugs (e.g., not associating the SSE stream with the correct session).
