# Vector-Processor MCP Server: Session Initialization Bug

## Problem Statement

The vector-processor MCP server is unable to process any tool calls because it never completes initialization and cannot create or track sessions. As a result, all attempts to use MCP tools fail with "Could not find session" errors.

---

## Implementation Status

### 1. Original Issues
- Server initialization not completing
- SSE connections failing with 503 errors
- Message handling failing with 404 errors

### 2. Implemented Solutions
- Added explicit service initialization with health checks
- Implemented initialization signaling with initialization_complete flag
- Added proper initialization state management
- Improved logging for debugging

### 3. Current Status

#### What's Fixed:
- Server initialization is working properly
- Health checks pass for all services
- SSE connections now succeed (HTTP 200)
- Server properly tracks initialization state
- Session registration mechanism implemented:
  - Session ID generation during SSE connection
  - Active sessions tracking with in-memory store
  - Session validation logic in message handling
  - Logging for session lifecycle events

#### Remaining Issues:
- Message handling still fails with "Could not find session" error despite:
  - Successful session registration (confirmed in logs)
  - Valid session ID being used in requests
  - Session validation passing
- Potential architectural issue:
  - Current implementation may not properly integrate with MCP protocol's session handling
  - Need to investigate standard MCP protocol practices for session management

```

### 2. Endpoint Tests

#### SSE Connection:
- Previous: HTTP 503 "Server not initialized"
- Current: HTTP 200 OK with active ping messages

#### Message Handling:
- Previous: HTTP 400 "Invalid session ID"
- Current: "Could not find session" despite:
  * Successful session registration in logs
  * Using correct session ID from registration
  * Session validation passing in code

## Updated Analysis

The session management implementation has been completed but reveals a potential architectural concern:

1. Current Implementation:
   - Session IDs are generated and registered during SSE connection
   - Active sessions are tracked in an in-memory store
   - Session validation is performed for message handling
   - Logging confirms the session lifecycle events

2. Observed Behavior:
   - SSE connections establish successfully
   - Session registration works (confirmed by logs)
   - Ping messages are received correctly
   - Message handling fails despite valid session

3. New Hypothesis:
   The issue may stem from a misalignment between our custom session management and the MCP protocol's standard practices. Specifically:
   - Our implementation manages sessions independently
   - The SseServerTransport's handle_post_message may have its own session handling
   - The two systems may not be properly integrated

### Areas for Investigation
1. MCP protocol's standard session management practices
2. SseServerTransport's internal session handling
3. Proper integration between custom session management and MCP protocol
4. Potential conflicts between the two session management systems

## Next Steps
1. Review MCP protocol documentation for session management standards
2. Analyze SseServerTransport implementation details
3. Identify correct integration points for session management
4. Consider refactoring to align with MCP protocol standards
