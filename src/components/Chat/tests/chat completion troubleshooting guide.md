Below is a suggested systematic approach and verification strategy. The key is to break the problem into small, testable pieces. Each step will build on the last, so you know exactly what works and what doesn’t.

A) Systematic Step-by-Step Plan

# 1 Basic SSE Endpoint in Flask (No Async Yet)
Create a simple Flask endpoint that returns hard-coded SSE messages in a loop (e.g., 5 messages, each “hello world”).
Use a generator function that yields valid SSE data ("data: <message>\n\n").
Goal: Validate that you can serve SSE from Flask in a minimal scenario before adding any async or streaming from OpenAI.
Reference: Flask SSE Patterns (though not official SSE docs, it covers streaming responses).
# 2 Front-End SSE Consumption in React (Browser Context)
In the browser-based environment, confirm you can connect to the SSE endpoint using the standard EventSource API or a library like fetch-event-source.
Display the incoming messages in the simplest possible way (e.g., console log or minimal <p> updates).
Goal: Ensure SSE messages flow properly to the client in a straightforward browser scenario.
Reference: MDN EventSource Docs.
# 3 SSE Consumption in Node Environment (If Needed)
If your React environment is on Node.js (e.g., SSR or specialized testing), you’ll need a dedicated SSE client library (like eventsource or fetch-event-source) because node-fetch alone doesn’t handle SSE out of the box.
Goal: Validate that you receive event-stream data in Node, properly handling chunk splits.
# 4 Introduce Async in Flask
Wrap your endpoint with Flask’s async features (using async def and an appropriate decorator, such as @copy_current_request_context or your @async_route).
Still keep the endpoint returning simple hard-coded messages in SSE, but do so asynchronously (e.g., await asyncio.sleep(...) between messages).
Goal: Confirm that introducing async does not break the streaming. You should still see the incremental SSE messages arrive in the client.
# 5 Add JSON Parsing on Client
Update your SSE endpoint to stream JSON data (e.g., {"message": "hello world"}).
On the client, parse these JSON chunks. Remember SSE can split data across chunks, so buffer the incoming text until you have a complete JSON object.
Goal: Ensure partial JSON chunks are reassembled properly before parsing.
# 6 Integrate with OpenAI Streaming
Replace your hard-coded SSE messages with calls to OpenAI’s streaming API.
On the Flask side:
Call OpenAI’s API in async chunks.
Stream the partial data immediately back to the client in SSE format.
Goal: Verify that your end-to-end pipeline still works when real-time data comes from OpenAI.
# 7 Finalize Context and Cleanup
Ensure your Flask request context is preserved during the entire streaming flow.
Properly close out the event loop and the request when streaming is complete.
Goal: No “premature close” or lost context errors should appear in the logs.

B) Verification at Each Step

# 1 Basic SSE Endpoint Verification
Use a browser or curl -N http://localhost:5000/your_sse_endpoint and confirm you see the stream in real time.
Logs in Flask should show each yield happening.
# 2 Front-End in React
Open dev tools console; you should see each SSE message logged or displayed in the UI.
If you’re using SSR/Node, do the same with your SSE client library to confirm data arrival.
# 3 Async Endpoint
Confirm the UI or console logs that messages appear incrementally (e.g., if you await asyncio.sleep(1) between yields, you should see ~1 second delays between messages).
# 4 JSON Parsing
Test with known JSON structures (e.g., {"step": 1}, {"step": 2}, etc.).
Deliberately break up the data (by sending partial JSON strings) to see if your buffer logic correctly reassembles the JSON.
# 5 OpenAI Integration
Verify that partial responses from OpenAI are streamed to the client.
Watch for errors in the Flask logs or in the browser console about broken JSON or lost context.
# 6 Final Request Context/Loop Cleanup
Ensure no warnings appear about closed event loops or missing request contexts in the logs.
Endpoints should gracefully end after the last chunk is sent.
By tackling these steps in order—verifying each milestone before moving on—you’ll avoid “chasing your tail.” If something fails, you’ll know exactly at which step (and which feature) broke.

Source note: The streaming details draw on both Flask’s official streaming docs and SSE client libraries such as fetch-event-source.

Good luck, and remember to always build on a known working baseline!
